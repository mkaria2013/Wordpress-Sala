This is Whois XML API integration for your WordPress website, which allows
adding tooltips with whois information for each domain name in your post content or comments.

== Description ==

Get a quick WHOIS review for all domain names on the web page.

The WHOIS XML API Plug-in automatically adds a tool-tip with summarized WHOIS information. It also adds a link to a public report, for all domains in the post-text and comments, on our website: [https://whoisapi.whoisxmlapi.com/](https://whoisapi.whoisxmlapi.com/).

The tooltip appears when a user hovers the cursor over a domain name in the text. You can then click on the link to conduct a more in-depth study of the domainâ€™s WHOIS record.

The integration of the tooltip is seamless and the WHOIS XML API Plug-in does not modify the content in any way. You are able to turn it off at any time, and all of the text will revert to its original format.
